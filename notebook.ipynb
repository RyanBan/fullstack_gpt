      "1. \"In the land of code, where serpents slither,\" - This line sets the scene for the poem, comparing the world of programming to a land where serpents (referring to Python's logo, which is a snake) move around.\n",

      "\n",
      "4. \"With indentation rules that make us all sigh.\" - Python is known for its strict indentation rules, which the poet suggests can be frustrating but are important for writing clean code.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. \"No curly braces or semicolons here,\" - Unlike some other programming languages, Python does not use curly braces or semicolons to denote code blocks or statements.\n",

      "7. \"From data structures to web apps galore,\" - Python can be used for a wide range of applications, from working with data structures to building web applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. \"Python's versatility we simply adore.\" - The poet expresses admiration for Python's flexibility and ability to adapt to different tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. \"With libraries aplenty, like NumPy and Flask,\" - Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries that extend its functionality, such as NumPy for numerical computing and Flask for web development.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. \"Python helps us tackle any coding task.\" - Python is seen as a versatile language that can be used for various programming challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. \"So here's to Python, our trusty friend,\" - The poet concludes by praising Python as a reliable and dependable tool for programmers."
